<h3>Hello! </h3>
<p>
I am a postdoctoral associate at <a href="https://linguistics.mit.edu" target="_blank">MIT linguistics</a>.
I received my PhD in the same department in 2024.
My dissertation investigated "unconventional" case phenomena like case-marked adverbials.
Before coming to MIT, I studied for a B.A. and M.A. in linguistics at <a href="https://linguist.snu.ac.kr/en" target="_blank">the Department of Linguistics at Seoul National University</a>.
You can reach me at <u>jou @ mit.edu</u> .
