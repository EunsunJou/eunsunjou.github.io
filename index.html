<p>
I am a third year PhD student at <a href="https://linguistics.mit.edu">the department of linguistics at MIT</a>.
My research interests include phenomena at the syntax-pragmatics interface.
More specifically, I am interested in how discourse-related elements are represented in the syntactic structure of sentences.
I am currently working on where in the sentence Korean addressee honorification is represented, and how it is syntactically licensed.
