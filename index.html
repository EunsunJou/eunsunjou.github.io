<p>
I am a third year Ph.D. student at <a href="https://linguistics.mit.edu" target="_blank">the department of linguistics at MIT</a>.
My research interests mainly lie in syntax and its interface with morphology and pragmatics.
I am also interested in computational phonology and learnability -- in my most recent project, I suggest an alternative algorithm that learns hidden metrical structure as an amendment to Robust Interpretive Parsing.
Before coming to MIT, I studied for a B.A. and M.A. in linguistics at <a href="https://linguist.snu.ac.kr/en" target="_blank">the department of linguistics at Seoul National University</a>.

<h3> Ongoing Projects </h3>
<p>
    <ul>
      <li> Analysis of honorification as agree, with a focus on Korean but also cross-linguistically </li>
      <li> An economy-based amendment to Robust Interpretive Parsing, based on the Gradual Learning Algorithm <br>
           My implementation of the GLA and the amendment is available on <a href="https://github.com/EunsunJou/Economy_RIPGLA" target="_blank">Github</a>.
