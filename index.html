<h3>Hello! </h3>
<p>
In 2024, I received my Ph.D. in linguistics at <a href="https://linguistics.mit.edu" target="_blank">Department of Linguistics and Philosophy at MIT</a>.
My dissertation investigated "unconventional" case phenomena such as case-marked adverbials and case stacking.
Before my Ph.D, I studied for a B.A. and M.A. in linguistics at <a href="https://linguist.snu.ac.kr/en" target="_blank">the Department of Linguistics at Seoul National University</a>.
You can reach me at <u>eunsun.jou @ gmail.com</u> .
