<h3>Hello! </h3>
<p>
From October 1st, 2025, I'll be starting a new position as an Assistant Professor at <a href="https://hss.kaist.ac.kr/" target="_blank">The School of Digital Humanities and Computational Social Sciences</a> at the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST).
</p>
<p>
As a linguist and syntactician, I explore the principles that underlie complex phenomena involving the structure of natural language.
Recently, I have growing interests in the biological underpinnings of these principles, as well as the role of linguistic knowledge in effective and safe use of large language models.
</p>
<p>
I received my Ph.D. in linguistics at <a href="https://linguistics.mit.edu" target="_blank">Department of Linguistics and Philosophy at MIT</a> in 2024.
Before my Ph.D, I studied for a B.A. and M.A. in linguistics at <a href="https://linguist.snu.ac.kr/en" target="_blank">the Department of Linguistics at Seoul National University</a>.
You can reach me at <u>eunsunjou @ kaist.ac.kr</u> .
