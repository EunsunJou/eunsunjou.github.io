I am a third year Ph.D. student at <a href="https://linguistics.mit.edu" target="_blank">the department of linguistics at MIT</a>.
My research interests include phenomena at the syntax-pragmatics interface.
More specifically, I am interested in how discourse-related elements are represented in the syntactic structure of sentences.
My most recent project focuses on where in the sentence Korean addressee honorification is represented, and how it is syntactically licensed. 
Before coming to MIT, I studied for a B.A. and M.A. in linguistics at <a href="https://linguist.snu.ac.kr/en" target="_blank">the department of linguistics at Seoul National University</a>.
